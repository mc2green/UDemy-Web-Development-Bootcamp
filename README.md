# UDemy-Web-Development-Bootcamp

Supplementing my computer science education, I signed up for UDemy's Web Development Bootcamp and these are some of the projects and exercises that I have finished. 

Each project has a README.md that shows the topcis covered and key technologies used, as well as examples of each project. Feel free to check them out!
